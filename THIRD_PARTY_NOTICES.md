## OpenUsage (MIT)

https://github.com/robinebers/openusage at commit
4ce788775e0cb3ec779d353b2ac9f9d7e8765bb4, adapted into
`Sources/NotchUsage/OpenUsage`: the provider integrations, usage models, pricing
engine, and services behind the AI Usage tab. Its price supplement ships as
`Sources/NotchUsage/Resources/pricing_supplement.json`. Each adapted file names
its origin in its header. ILoveNotch's changes: its own cache folder and
User-Agent, no reset-credit claiming, no Antigravity token renewal (it embeds
Antigravity's OAuth client secret), and a rebuilt UI. "OpenUsage" and its
logo are Robin Ebers' trademarks. ILoveNotch doesn't use the logo, and isn't
affiliated with or endorsed by OpenUsage.
